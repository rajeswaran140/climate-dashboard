## ✨ Key Takeaway

**You don't need funding to START!**

Everything you need is FREE:
- ✅ Hosting (Vercel)
- ✅ Data (NASA/NOAA)
- ✅ Tools (VS Code, Git, npm)
- ✅ Domain (.vercel.app)

**Build first. Get users. Then seek support.**

NASA and organizations are much more likely to support a project that:
- Already exists ✅
- Has users ✅
- Shows impact ✅
- Demonstrates commitment ✅

vs. "I want to build this, can you fund me?"
